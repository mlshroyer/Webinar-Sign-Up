Webinar-Sign-Up
===============

This project is designed to streamline the process of requesting a Webinar invite and to ensure that requests are made
for available and scheduled webinars.  This is to avoid users thinking they are going to be learning material that is
in fact not included in the webinar.

Specific webinar information is to be stored in JSON format and manipulated through the webinar_select.js

The selection process is designed to allow the user to select an available webinar topic and then select available times.
